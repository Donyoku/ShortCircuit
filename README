This project has been carried by SALA Ergi, SIBUE Quentin, LAPLANTE Juliette, ANCRENAZ Arianne, [insert julien last name] Julien , and me CASTANO Nicolas.
Everything that comes after this version 1.0 will be the fruit of CASTANO Nicolas and potentially LAPLANTE Juliette for some new sprites.

All the sprites used are made by LAPLANTE Juliette.
All rights for the parser part belong to M Perrin Michael.
